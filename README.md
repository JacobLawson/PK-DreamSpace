# PK DreamSpace
 A Video Drug background editor for GameMaker Studio 2
PK DreamSpace is a tool I've written to generate video drug backgrounds like those featured in the EarthBound/Mother series. These backgrounds can be exported into a JSON format for use in external projects that use my layered background format.
