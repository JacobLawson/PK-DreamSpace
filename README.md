# PK DreamSpace
A Video Drug background editor for GameMaker Studio 2
 
PK DreamSpace is a tool I've written to generate video drug backgrounds like those featured in the EarthBound/Mother series. These backgrounds can be exported into a JSON format for use in external projects that use my layered background format.

# current features
- Saving and loading background JSON files.
- Add and remove an unlimited number of fully controllable layers.
- Control how layers blend together with Blend Mode controls.
- Scan line interlacing effect with variable control.
- fully controllable sine wave effects.
- palette controls.

# future plans
- scrolling effects.
- custom scripting for animations and improved palette swapping.
- Full screen visualizer.
- Load new sprites and palettes from files (currently editing source is required).
